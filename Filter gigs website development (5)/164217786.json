If you are new to Fiverr, many \"developers\" you work with are only the English speaking person and they have someone else doing the coding. This is NOT the case with Huzaifa. He works directly with you and he is an expert coder. This has significantly streamlined our project timelines. His expertise is extremely impressive and his communication is outstanding. Thank you again Huzaifa for all of your hard work!",
