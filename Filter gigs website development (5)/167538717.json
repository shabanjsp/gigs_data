We also had to implement additional logic as legacy data caused unforseen issues and I faced some troubles deloying the code, which Sourav delivered flawlessly. Through all of that, I could count on Souravs patiences and guidance to get the project successfully done, which was much appreciated. I can recommend working with him - he knows his craft very well and is a pleasure to work with. ",
