            "comment": "Working with Rehan was great. I gave him a detailed document of everything I was looking for & he exceeded my expectations. Everything was quick & easy. He would reach out when he needed clarification instead of assuming what I meant in my overview, which I was happy about because he was able to truly reflect my vision of the website. He was very polite & kind throughout the entirety of the project which made this experience really great for me since I was not as familiar with web design. He recommended better alternatives regarding hosting sites & website plans that would best enhance my efforts with the website, going above & beyond his role to help me succeed. Thank you, Rehan",

            "comment": "I would have loved to give Rehan a five-star rating. He was kind, patient, and responsive throughout the project. However, the form used for account registration on my website was not user-friendly, and the changes I requested were not possible. Additionally, some issues I had raised were not fully resolved, requiring me to follow up multiple times.\n\nThat said, Rehan delivered great work overall, and I\u2019m happy with the changes that were implemented. While the project took longer than expected to go live\u2014partly due to my delayed responses\u2014it was a well-executed job in the end.",

From our very first conversation, they took the time to truly understand my vision and brand identity. Their creativity and attention to detail really impressed me\u2014I could tell they were invested in making sure every element worked seamlessly and looked amazing.\n\nThroughout the entire process, they kept me in the loop with regular updates, listened to my feedback, and offered valuable suggestions that improved the overall functionality and user experience. The final design is not only visually stunning but also easy to navigate, and I've already received compliments from clients who appreciate the new, modern look.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for someone who\u2019s both professional and passionate about web design, I highly recommend working with them. They exceeded my expectations and delivered a site that perfectly represents my business!",
