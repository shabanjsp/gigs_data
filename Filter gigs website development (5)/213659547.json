            "comment": "Overall, working with Mohammad was a positive experience, though there are a few areas that could be enhanced. Things started off smoothly, but towards the end, we did feel some pressure to finalize the project quickly, even with a few important tasks still pending. As new business owners, we took extra time to ensure everything met our expectations, and a bit more patience on his side would have been appreciated.\n\nMohammad was very responsive throughout, but we had hoped for more input on design and functionality. Since we were new to website development, we ended up relying heavily on our own ideas, providing most of the content, images, and layout suggestions.\n\nHe may be better suited to clients with more experience in website projects. That said, the final result was satisfactory, despite some minor challenges along the way, and we see room for future improvements. Thank you.",
