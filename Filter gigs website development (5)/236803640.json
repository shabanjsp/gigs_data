I'm very big on detail and design aesthetics, and there was no issue with any changes I've wanted; they will work with you to ensure the project is completed exactly to your liking. I do want to highlight how patient they've been with me - it's the best feeling working with someone who doesn't make you feel like you're annoying for wanting something done a specific way.",
