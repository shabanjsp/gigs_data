After working with John, I understand the reason for all of the great reviews. John was able to quickly commit to a short deadline and deliver a script for API calls very quickly. This work took a great stress off of the plates of our IT department that has numerous high-profile projects occurring at the same time. It was an absolute pleasure to work with John. He was a wonderful professional. ",
