            "comment": "Husen has done a great job. He built a website for us in Worpress (5 main pages + ~10 sub pages) and created custom plugins. Based on a design created in FIgma, he was able to realize the website 1:1. The plugin also works perfectly. Even when the design of the website had to be adapted at short notice, he was able to implement this very quickly.\n\nPro:\n- Proactive and fast communication. \n- Very professional\n- Good price/performance ratio\n- Ongoing support for questions and problems\n\nContra:\n- Nothing worth mentioning\n\nI can highly recommend Husen / ConicPlex.",

            "comment": "I had the pleasure of working with Husen, who developed our website from scratch.From the very start, his positive attitude and consistent smile made the entire process smooth and enjoyable. The best part about working with him is his incredible ability to quickly pinpoint the root cause of any issue. He doesn't just patch things up; he dives deep to resolve problems at their core, ensuring that everything runs seamlessly.\n\nHusen's professionalism, problem-solving skills, and work ethic are second to none. I have no doubt that if he continues to keep his head on his shoulders and that smile on his face, he will go a long way. His dedication to quality and attention to detail make him a true asset to any project.\n\nThank you, Husen, for everything you've done for both Evolve Snacks and Khelmanch. Looking forward to more collaborations with you in the future!\"\n\n\u2014 Angad Sehgal, Founder of Evolve Snacks and Khelmanch",
