            "comment": "While working with this freelancer on a web page design project, I encountered some challenges that impacted the final outcome. The expertise in coding was not as strong as I had hoped, particularly in terms of attention to detail. The initial design did not align with the provided template regarding colors, item spacing, or sizes. Although there was some improvement after requesting edits\u2014slightly better alignment with the color scheme\u2014it still did not meet my expectations. Consequently, the landing page template did not turn out to be successful, and I opted to proceed with a different designer.\n\nDespite these issues, I want to acknowledge the freelancer's professionalism mostly throughout the process. He accepted the feedback, which I appreciated. It's clear there's potential, and with more focus on detail and expertise enhancement, I believe future projects could see better outcomes. Thank you for your efforts, and I wish you all the best in your future endeavors.",
