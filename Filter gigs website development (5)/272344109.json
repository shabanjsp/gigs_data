            "comment": "My experience with CodePanda was very frustrating. When we began the project, they gave me advice on the project and were helpful. We decided to build the site on Wordpress rather than Ghost based on their recommendations. But when we began building it, it was a completely different story.\n\nFirst of all, they said the project was finished when it clearly wasn't. None of the site was built when they marked the project as done. I messaged the team to extend the delivery date, but they didn't do it. \n\nI had to threaten them 2-3 times that I would file a dispute with Fiverr for them to start building the site. Even then, the communication was horrible. They would tell me something would take 1-2 hours and I would wait for days with no response. They would just ignore me. Or make up an excuse of some sort. \n\nOverall, my experience was frustrating. And honestly a waste of time. I tried to give the CodePanda team plenty of opportunities to redeem themselves. but it just wasted more time. Unfortunately now I have to go back and do things the right way. ",
