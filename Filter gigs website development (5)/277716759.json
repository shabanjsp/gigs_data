I am not impressed by work quality I experienced during the project. She lacks professionalism, takes long to answer and replies with very short messages, ignored reminders of correction on the website. I had to repeat the same thing to correction several times. She asked for extention two times. First time when she asked for extension for 7 days it was understandable, the second time I refused. She might reply here she did so becaue of I did not supply with necessary video/photo images. As I wrote above her answers took long and very short.",
