Details regarding the form were not understood (the text above the form and below the form I requested where not added. Also the form had a \"message\" field that was not required. This is likely due to working with templates - which is fine. Attention to detail needs improvement. Thank you for your services.",

Highly recommend his services!",

We documented every single revision necessary \u2014 he often missed entire sections or said they were done and they were incomplete. He also sent an update to us on work he\u2019s doing for another client, showing lack of professionalism and further intention to detail. \n\nThe worst part: he published the draft in progress website live, and didn\u2019t realize what he did and didn\u2019t know how to correct it. \n\nHave never worked with someone I\u2019ve rated this poorly. We were extremely disappointed in the end and took many matters into our own hands to fix just to get the project finished. ",
