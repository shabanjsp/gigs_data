            "comment": "Working with Shuaib was an absolute pleasure. There are so many things that can go wrong when working with a new provider and none of them happened with Shoaib. He was careful to review documentation, provided feedback and ideas, and generally made sure that the app was solid and to spec. Our client is thrilled with the end result and so are we! I would highly recommend Shoaib to anyone needing a skilled back end developer with a great attitude. Thank you Shoaib!",

He also took ownership of the server side and publication. Working with him was easy and smooth. For sure will reach out for future implementations and new projects.",
