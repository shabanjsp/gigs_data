            "comment": "Unfortunately, I had high hopes for this freelancer. It took days for them to get started and then after waiting that long they delivered a page that still had 4 sections missing and didn't do any responsiveness updates to the page. I ordered 3 pages, they delivered half of one and never responded back after a week of saying the project wasn't finished. I had to get Fiverr support involved just to fix it since they wouldn't respond. I do not recommend them at all. ",
