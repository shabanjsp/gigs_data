While responsive and understanding, response time, effort, and politeness could use refinement. Overall, Swapon's dedication and ability to go the extra mile stand out, but there's room for growth in key areas.",

He was very responsive and we were able to successfully complete our task. I would use his services again and I would recommend him to others, but be mindful of the language barrier and time zone challenges. Lastly, I'd recommend establishing clear expectations for the start of the project.",
