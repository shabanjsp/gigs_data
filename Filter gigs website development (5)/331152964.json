            "comment": "Ammara was nothing short of incredible. She genuinely went above and beyond, I was so impressed. My web developer is away at the moment and I needed someone to urgently help me with the integration of an affiliate marketing program into the landing page of my website. Not only did she get back to me within minutes, she meticulously researched the integration process, did the entire integration so quickly, tested it and was super thorough to ensure a seamless tracking process, knowing that it's a really imperative that it correctly tracks. She then happily added some testimonials to my landing page when I asked, even though that wasn't necessarily part of the job description, she understood that it's really crucial to drive conversions and that my web developer is a away, so she helped me out. She also offered me unlimited support if there are any issues with the integration going forward. There won't be any issues I'm confident she did an amazing job. She was a pleasure to work with and just an extremely lovely person. I highly recommend her. 6 stars out of 5!",

There was a lot of back and forth with questions that had already been answered. However, I am satisfied with the end product. Ammara had great design ideas that I would not have thought of. I am pleased with the results. ",
