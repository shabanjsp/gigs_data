            "comment": "I feel incredibly grateful and LUCKY to have found Ramiz to help build my website. He went above and beyond anything I could have expected. Ramiz is super responsive, professional, polite, and incredibly patient (and trust me, I\u2019m not the easiest client to deal with, lol). If it weren\u2019t for his follow-through and support, I\u2019m not sure I would have completed the project. I was going through a very difficult time in my personal life, and he was so understanding and encouraging, helping me see the project through to completion. No one has ever treated me with so much patience and kindness, and I will be forever grateful to him.\n\nRamiz is also exceptionally talented and extremely knowledgeable about web development, SEO, and creative design. As someone who isn\u2019t very skilled with technology and gets overwhelmed easily, I cannot overstate how reassuring and helpful he was throughout the process. He made everything so much less stressful and even went out of his way to create custom instructional videos specifically for my site!\n\nBy far, Ramiz is the best professional I\u2019ve ever worked with for my online business. I only wish I could hire him for all my technical projects! If you\u2019re considering working with him, don\u2019t hesitate\u2014you won\u2019t find anyone better. Thank you, Ramiz, for your outstanding work. You will always be my go-to website guy for any future projects.",

He also took the time to make a video showing me how to make edits to my own website and ensuring I had what I needed to make my website live (domain + hosting site).  He was thorough, efficient, and patient.  Great work and I will definitely go to Ramiz for additional website needs!",

From start to finish, he was extremely accessible, always quick to respond, and made every change I requested at lightning speed. The final website is nothing short of stunning\u2014clean, modern, and exactly what I had envisioned.\n\nA special shoutout also goes to his team member Pravin, who was instrumental in supporting the project behind the scenes. Together, they brought my dream website to life, and I couldn\u2019t be more grateful for their incredible talent and dedication. If you want a killer website, Ramiz (and Pravin!) are the way to go\u2014hands down!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
