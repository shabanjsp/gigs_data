I hired Alice to complete the backend setup of Booqable and integrate it into my website. After enthusiastically encouraging me to accept her quote, that\u2019s when things went quiet. With 2-3 days between responses, each time met with an excuse or just a one line message of little help or updates about the project. After checking myself, I could see that nothing had been touched. I couldn\u2019t possible recommend Alice to anyone if this is the standard of work/communication you can expect. I\u2019m now left feeling extremely disappointed and now my project launch is delayed.
