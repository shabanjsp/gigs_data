The first project - website design was very good. \nThe second project wasn't.\nDeck design project was challenging, mainly due to a lack of professionalism and attention to details, which did not meet my expectations. Communication was frustrating as basic logic wasn't always implemented, and it felt like I had to explain things repeatedly without progress. Ultimately, the low effort and prolonged timeline led me to abandon the collaboration and complete the task myself.",

            "comment": "Don't know where to start from. I had a working and well designed onepager website which needed some finishing. First, they priced me for 5 pages, but I renegotiated later. \nSecond, they literally demolished the neat structure of the page. No sense of size and proportions. they kept adding unnecessary transitions and after 2 weeks I had to stop them and start from scratch. \nThere was no added value, only constant frustration. \nThe final delivery is worse than what they started with. As one reviewer said rightfully,  they left me with a carcas.  A one week job procrastinated into one month, and now I am looking for someone else. BUT I WONT BE LOOKING ON FIVERR. \n\nFIVERR aowed these guys to  boost their 5 star reviews through fake comments as these guys couldn't  have had 500 jobs in a couple of months! I won't be trusting FIVERR reviews as they are misleading. Bad job, FEVERR!, one star for you!\n\n",
