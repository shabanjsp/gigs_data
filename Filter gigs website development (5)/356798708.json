Improvements in attention to detail and communication skills, especially in language fluency, could enhance the overall collaborative process. Despite these hurdles, Harun was incredibly accommodating throughout the revisions, ultimately delivering a final product that matched my vision.\n\nHe was willing to do a zoom call with me to discuss my revisions live and helped me along the way. I didn't know the first thing about word press and now I can use it well enough to get by. Thank you Harun, I recommend him for any website projects you may have.",
