I don\u2019t know much about developing websites but I feel as if I took a course, as now I know the language, process, etc as they kept me within the loop the whole time. I am very pleased with my website and will be working with Mahmodul again in the near future !!",

I provided detailed instructions and even included screenshots to guide them, but they still struggled to implement the changes correctly. Toward the end, they tried to pressure me into accepting the project delivery, citing concerns about their rating, even though the work wasn\u2019t completed as expected. Ultimately, they couldn\u2019t finalize it to my standards, and I had to step in and finish it myself.",
