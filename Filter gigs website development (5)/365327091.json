The only reason I put 4-stars was the timeline was not quite as expected, but he delivered an awesome product in the end and was very attentive to detail. He was responsive and communicative throughout the process, as well, which makes a huge difference when working with someone on a platform like Fiverr. All gratitude to Shahid for his work!",
