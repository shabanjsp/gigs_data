However, it got better over time as the seller improved communication. That said, I had to give step-by-step guidance many times, and even then, some tasks were not done correctly. There was a clear lack of attention to detail - not just in creativity, but even in basic tasks like aligning boxes and pages, which were repeatedly missed. My team and I had to remind the seller about these details several times. I do appreciate their efforts to fix the issues, though.\n\nAs for the timeline, the project was not finished on time. It was supposed to take 15 days but ended up taking more than 18. Although it was delayed, the seller did try to complete it.\n\nOverall, the work was just average - not great, but not terrible either. However, for the price and the amount of guidance I had to give, it was disappointing and not worth it. The service was advertised as providing user-friendly and well-designed results, but it required constant supervision and still didn\u2019t meet expectations. That said, I appreciate the seller\u2019s willingness to improve and hope they continue to get better.",

            "comment": "My experience was overall unsatisfactory. A custom theme was initially promised, but instead, Webflow code was used within Elementor boxes. This not only caused unexpected delays in completing the project but also resulted in a slow website performance due to the excessive number of plugins used.\n\nAnother disappointment was the lack of skill in handling basic corrections, which became apparent on several occasions. The slow response time to messages also did nothing to alleviate my concerns. These issues forced me to seek alternative solutions to meet the initial project requirements.\n\nOverall, despite efforts to offer improvements, the lack of experience with custom themes and poor communication severely impacted my impression of the service.\n\nUltimately, I opted for a partial cancellation to fairly acknowledge the work done by Link Tech, while addressing the remaining needs of my project with another, more experienced freelancer.",

Though the starting part was rough because it did not meet my expectations, but they were able to turn the table around and made sure everything is according to my requests. They are very capable but they must have shown it from the start. Overall it was a great experience. Thank you. ",
