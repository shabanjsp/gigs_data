            "comment": "Mixed Experience Good Design, But Project Expectations Not Met\n\nThe freelancer delivered a solid Figma design, which met expectations. However, there were misalignments in project expectations and an extended timeline beyond what was initially discussed. Despite clearly defined milestones and agreements, adjustments were made after the design phase that did not align with the original scope of work.\n\nWhile I appreciate the design work, the overall experience was frustrating due to the lack of clarity in project execution. Communication and adherence to initial agreements could have been better. If working with this freelancer, I recommend ensuring that all expectations are clearly outlined.",
