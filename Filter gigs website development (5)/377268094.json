He took the time to walk me through everything step by step, and I never felt rushed. His patience and clear explanations really boosted my confidence to make the necessary changes. I highly recommend him!",

Some instructions were not fully followed, and inconsistencies in the work required me to step in for corrections and improvements.\n\nCommunication was acceptable, but I felt that my requests were not always understood or addressed as I hoped.\n\nFor simple needs, this might work fine, but if your project requires a certain level of finesse or attention to detail, I recommend thoroughly clarifying expectations upfront.",

That being said, because I didn't have much to offer him, he was more focused on building out the format than all the details. Understandably. With more direction next time I'm sure the site would be even better!! ",

He was incredibly responsive to any messages I sent him and he had the project done AHEAD OF TIME.  I wish I had known about him 5 years ago when I had the last upgrade done on my website.  He knocked it out of the park.  I would recommend him to anyone needing help with their Wordpress site without reservation.  ",
