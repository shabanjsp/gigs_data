If looking for any webflow work don't get caught into trap of hiring more expensive ones as you think they will be better... he's 10X better than the other people I have paid 3X as much for webflow work on this platform because they were from UK, USA etc.\n\nGot my business for life with anything webflow - thanks :)",

I love that Salehin gave himself a realistic timeline of 5 days, while communicating that it most likely wouldn't take that long. The work was finished in 2 days and is exceptional!
