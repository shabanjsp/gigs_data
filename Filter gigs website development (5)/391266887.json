            "comment": "Designed a good website. However tortured me so much until he transferred it. He keeps saying I will check and get back to you. He transferred it first to a domain that was not mine. The problem is that when there is any issue, he doesn't ask, he just leaves it and keeps promising he'll get back to you, and never does. In the end the website was transferred to me with a lot of errors, media was not displaying and I had to re edit it my self. The seller can do good stuff as per the design but he definitely has communication problems. ",

            "comment": "!!!Customer Warning!!!\nI rarely write negative reviews, but my experience warrants sharing this as a cautionary tale. I hired Arif to build a stock portfolio website for $1,500, divided into three deliverables. As part of the project, I provided him with the username and password to the website I wanted replicated. My intention, as a software developer, was to use his foundational work as a basis for me to upgrade and maintain the website going forward.\n\nThe first deliverable was to create Figma files for the entire website, for which I paid $369.25. We agreed upon the requirements, and he was given 10 days to complete the design with slight modifications to the reference website I provided. I followed up three days before the deadline, and he reassured me that everything was on track. However, on the day of the deadline, he delivered two incomplete and carelessly hand-drawn pages that fell drastically short of expectations. To provide context, I\u2019ve attached a public link showcasing the work he submitted.\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1IVjTDz9nT831pJiMQVry_DhpTitbQ0sA/view?usp=sharing\n\nDespite his high ratings, my experience suggests they may not reflect the reality of his work. I strongly recommend seeking an alternative freelancer for your project needs.\n",
